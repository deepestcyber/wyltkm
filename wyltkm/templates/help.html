<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
    <i>WYLTKM?</i> is a generator for QR-Codes. It was created for the Makerspace
    <a href="https://attraktor.org">Attraktor e.V.</a> in Hamburg, Germany.
    <i>WYLTKM?</i> allows everyone in the Makerspace, to easily create QR-Codes that
    provide access to information on various projects. The created QR-Codes have a
    design that is easily recognised, so that you will be able to quickly spot them
    wherever they are installed.
</p><p>
    You can find <a href="https://wiki.attraktor.org/Would_you_like_to_know_more%3F">more about this project</a>
    in the Attraktor Wiki (in German).
</p>

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>
    Simple enter the URL you want to link to and a short descriptive text as a heading.
    You can use the preview button for quick feedback (the PNG is not perfect, it might not even work as QR,
    but you can see the design). When you are done, use the SVG button to get the actual SVG file
    created for you.
</p>

<h2>What is this SVG?</h2>
<p>
    The image is created as a Scalable Vector Graphic that only consists of primitives (rects and paths,
    basically, no font/text included). The images can be scaled to any size you need without quality loss.
    They are suitable for laser cutters, plotters and the like.
</p>

<h2>What is the &quot;border&quot;?</h2>
<p>
    QR-Codes require a <i>quiet zone</i> around it, that should consist of a background coloured space
    the size of four of the QR-Codes &quot;pixels&quot;. Scanners often work without the quiet zone,
    but all diversions from the standard make it more likely that the scanning fails. When displayed
    on the edge of a monitor with a dark frame, scanning might fail (the light colours used for
    the code don't help either). So the default of adding the border helps while designing.
    When you integrate the code somewhere you should take care about that yourself. It might be more convenient
    to have the SVG without a border, so that why there is the option.
</p>

<h2>How it is done?</h2>
<p>
    The codes are generated by a python script that is embedded in a minimal Flask web app to provide a
    user interface. The program is open source an can be found on GitHub:<br>
    <a href="{{ APP_INFO.source }}">{{ APP_INFO.source }}</a>
</p><p>
    The program is written for this special purpose, so it might not fit anyone else's needs. But feel
    free to take a lock, create a fork, or participate by opening pull requests.
