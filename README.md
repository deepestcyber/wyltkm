WYLTKM is a tool for generating QR-Codes. It was created for the maker space 
[Attraktor e.V.][attraktor], to make it easy to create QR-Codes that supply 
additional information about projects and workshops.

The project consists of two parts: a lib-like module `generate.py` that handles the 
generation of the QR code, and a simple [Flask][flask] app, that provides a wsgi-webserver, that 
provides a form for easy generation.
